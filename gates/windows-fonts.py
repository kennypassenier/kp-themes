"""The shipped fonts as TrueType, for Windows.

Windows installs .ttf and .otf, not .woff2, so windows/apply.ps1 cannot use
fonts/ as it is. This decompresses every face in fonts/families.json into
windows/fonts/<file>.ttf (ignored by git: they are rebuilt from fonts/, which
is the source) and writes windows/fonts/fonts.json, which maps each family
name a theme's font stack can name to its files.

The family name is the one the themes' font stacks use: families.json's
`renamed` for the faces renamed over a Reserved Font Name (KP Tech Mono,
KP Outrun Display, KP Ticker Mono), else its `family`. Each file gets that
name as its typographic family (name ID 16), because a variable font's plain
family (ID 1) names its default instance ("Big Shoulders Display Thin"), and
Windows would register the family under that.

Usage: python3 gates/windows-fonts.py        (needs fonttools and brotli)
